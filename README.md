# DistributedIsolationForest

In this project we implemented a distributed versions of the Isolation Forest algorithm. We compare our implementation to 3 other implementations:

1. Sklearn-IForest - non distributed version of Isolation Forest
2. SynapseML - distributed implementation by Microsoft

We compare the performance on the following datasets:

- Shuttle
- Annthyroid
- ForestCover
- Arrhythmia
- Particle
- YearP

This project was done as part of Big Data Platform course @ RUNI.
